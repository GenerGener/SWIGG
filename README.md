# Hooray_Jason_for_Sneaking_Graphs_into_this_Hackathon

## Aims

We want to be able to build a graph representation of and visualize a highly variable portion of the genome.

Aim 1: Build a graph of the MHC region in the human genome using the 8 alternative sequences from HGR38.

Aim 2: Visualize this graph!

Aim 3: Validate how well the graph representation works using simulations (deleting/inserting/mutating bases from these alternative reference sequences.

Aim 4: Extend to another region, or use alternative dataset (1kg) to train/construct the graph.
